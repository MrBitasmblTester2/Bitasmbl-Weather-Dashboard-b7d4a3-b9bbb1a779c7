# Bitasmbl-Weather-Dashboard-b7d4a3-b9bbb1a779c7

## Description
Build a web application that displays current weather, multi-day forecasts, and visualizes trends with charts. The project focuses on integrating APIs, dynamic front-end updates, and data visualization for an interactive user experience.

## Tech Stack
- Java
- Express.js
- React

## Requirements
- Fetch real-time weather data from a public API
- Display multi-day weather forecasts with clear UI elements
- Visualize temperature, humidity, or other metrics with charts
- Support user interactions, such as searching by city
- Optionally cache API responses to improve performance

## Installation
bash
git clone https://github.com/MrBitasmblTester2/Bitasmbl-Weather-Dashboard-b7d4a3-b9bbb1a779c7.git
cd Bitasmbl-Weather-Dashboard-b7d4a3-b9bbb1a779c7


## Usage
- Run Java backend as configured
- Run Express.js server as configured
- Run React development server as configured

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up Java and Express.js backends for handling weather data.
2. Integrate a public weather API for real-time data and forecasts.
3. Implement React components for current weather and multi-day forecasts.
4. Add chart components to visualize metrics such as temperature and humidity.
5. Implement city search interactions on the React front end.
6. Add optional caching of API responses.
7. Connect front end to back ends and validate interactive behavior.
